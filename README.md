A Particle Emmiter
=================

##### What is this?
![alt text](truong-promo.gif "particle emitter")
For a [story about online trolling](https://www.buzzfeed.com/lamvo/heres-what-it-feels-like-to-be-trolled-in-trumps-america), we at the BuzzFeed Open Lab put together an animated data visualization.

##### What problem does this solve?
Visualizing more than a few thousand data points in d3.js can get a little heavy on the browser because you have to animate thousands of individual `<svg>` elements. Using `<canvas>` allows you to manipulate and update pixels instead.

##### Project background
The code for this project came from an in-class exercise Iâ€™ve modified to make this graphic.

[Eric Haseltine](https://twitter.com/erichaseltine), the JavaScript instructor who introduced me to the joy of canvas.

##### Dependencies

For this project you need `underscore.js` and `JQuery` for the counter. The canvas animation is written in `JavaScript`.

```
<script src="js/libs/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/libs/underscore-1.6.0.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
```
